excerpt: My personal website, phlippieb.dev, is live! It was built in a few days using Astro JS. I couldn't find a template I liked, and also liked the idea of making it exactly to my liking, so the content and styling was all done by hand in HTML and CSS. See the footer for a link to the source.

The site is currently hosted on GitHub Pages, but I'm thinking of moving the hosting to another provider as this has broken some of my other content on GitHub Pages. Netlify seems really hot right now. Also considering Cloudflare Pages, since my DNS registration was done through Cloudflare.
