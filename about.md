I am a software developer working mostly in Swift on iOS. I work at [Retro Rabbit](http://retrorabbit.co.za){:target="_blank"} in Pretoria, South Africa, and mostly work on the iOS platform for [Kalido](http://kalido.me){:target="_blank"}. I like to play with design patterns and ergonomics that bring production code and plain English closer together.

I completed a master's degree in compuational intelligence - specifically, in particle swarm optimisers - which has mostly left me with the realisation that I really know much about computational intelligence or particle swarm optimisers.

I also play bass in a band called [Friends With Pools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P99kd2nivp8){:target="_blank"}, and I sometimes [make music](https://soundcloud.com/phlippie-bosman){:target="_blank"} on my computer.
