_Adding a configured method to variable types to help you organise your code while keeping things concise._

# Closure initialisation

In our Swift codebase, we make extensive use of the “[closure initialisation](https://medium.com/the-traveled-ios-developers-guide/swift-initialization-with-closures-5ea177f65a5){:target="_blank"}” standard. For example, instead of writing this:

{% gist 91db608a1d8a758ed554ac54e4a0b5f4 %}

We would write this:

{% gist 6d2b40459d3654f18ab9638caeead836 %}

It’s a good standard, one with many advantages. For example, it provides a clear, single location in the code where most, if not all, of the configuration for a particular UI element is done.
However, as you may have noticed, we are forced to write out the type of the variable twice —- once to declare the type of the variable and once to initialise its value.

This may be desired in some cases. The external-facing type being separated from the internal type, in combination with polymorphism (either through subclassing or through protocols), allows us to declare variables using the most useful general type and hide the specifics of the actual type to any clients. I might, for example, declare a `UILabel` property but initialise the value with an instance of my own `FancyLabel` subclass. Or, I might declare the property to be `UITableViewDataSource` and interchangeably use various conforming types as the actual value, without having to worry about how that affects clients of the property.

However, in practice, we don’t often get this advantage; we usually declare and initialise exactly the same type. If you create enough variables written in this style, it starts to get a little tedious. Furthermore, when using a type that is already tedious to type out, the tedium doubles. For example, try declaring a couple of these variables:

{% gist 6f9641f69182a9c72eb4aa10748f287f %}

How about a more finger-friendly standard?

# Map

We want to combine the advantage of _not_ using the closure initialisation standard —- namely, the ability for a variable’s type to be inferred from its initialisation —- with the advantages of the standard —- such as the ability to perform the configuration of an object as part of its declaration.

We already have a pattern for what this could like, courtesy of Swift’s semi-functional paradigm. The `map` function allows us to replace a multi-statement sequence such as this:

{% gist c2190c9b0c079fd68297375310c0f4c5 %}

With this:

{% gist ad1998648344680954ca1fd7ad8ce2db %}

So taking our cue from this type of syntax, why don't we add a `configured` method to the types of variables we would like to configure upon declaration? It should be basically like being able to `map` over a single variable.

# Configured

Our configuration method will be very simple, and the implementation will be the same for all types. An easy way to add a method to arbitrary types is to declare a protocol, then extend that protocol with the method to add:

{% gist 835dd4e504c325aa04b2d5f92d4045ab %}

Any type can now get this method for free by just conforming to `InlineConfigurable`. 

Let’s extend `NSObject`:

{% gist e476de8dbc1025b8179ddc68314219d1 %}

And just like that, most of the types provided by the various iOS SDKs are magically configurable. If we want this functionality for types we define ourselves, we can either inherit them from `NSObject` or simply conform them to `InlineConfigurable`.

And finally, here is how we use it:

{% gist 9dda1d43dcd1a952e98bd7736039b722 %}

Blammo!

# Cocoapods

UPDATE 9 August 2019:

I made a CocoaPods version of this. It’s called `PHBApplying`, and you can use it like this:

{% gist db4a6b269d7df96d9ce6c385d82ec2a7 %}

I changed the name from `configured` to `applying` because, as [Maciej Najbar pointed out in the comments on Medium](https://medium.com/@MaciejNajbar){:target="_blank"}, this concept is called *apply* in Kotlin (thanks Maciej!)

I also discovered that this concept has already been implemented as a CocoaPod called [Then](https://github.com/devxoul/Then){:target="_blank"}. Their existing implementation is a notch above my own, but I disagree with the naming, because `then` is commonly associated with asynchronous operations.

See PHBApplying on [GitHub](https://github.com/phlippieb/PHBApplying){:target="_blank"} or [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/PHBApplying){:target="_blank"}.
